# Pharmacy Management System - Backend

A comprehensive backend implementation for a pharmacy management system built with TypeScript. This backend supports all the features visible in the UI components including analytics, customer management, inventory management, and sales tracking.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The backend is organized into several service layers:

### Core Services

1. **AnalyticsService** - Business intelligence and reporting
2. **CustomerService** - Customer management and medical records
3. **InventoryService** - Product and stock management
4. **SalesService** - Transaction processing and sales reporting
5. **InventoryAnalyticsService** - Advanced inventory analytics and movement analysis

### Data Layer

- **Types** (`src/types.ts`) - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Mock Data** (`src/data/mockData.ts`) - Realistic sample data for development

## üìä Features

### Analytics & Reporting
- Sales analytics with time range filtering
- Customer segmentation and behavior analysis
- Product performance tracking
- Revenue, profit, and growth metrics
- AI-powered insights and forecasting
- Interactive dashboard data

### Customer Management
- Complete customer CRUD operations
- Medical history and allergy tracking
- Insurance information management
- Purchase history and loyalty points
- QR code generation for customers
- Drug interaction and allergy warnings
- Customer search and advanced filtering

### Inventory Management
- Product management for both drugs and grocery items
- Real-time stock level monitoring
- Low stock and expiry alerts
- Batch number and expiry date tracking
- Drug-specific information (dosage, interactions, contraindications)
- Stock movement tracking
- Automated reorder recommendations

### Sales & Transactions
- Point-of-sale transaction processing
- Multiple payment method support
- Prescription management
- Sales reporting and analytics
- Refund processing
- Daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends

### Advanced Inventory Analytics
- Product movement analysis (fast/medium/slow/dead stock)
- Turnover rate calculations
- Velocity scoring
- Reorder point optimization
- Category-wise performance analysis

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. The backend is implemented as TypeScript services that can be imported directly
2. All dependencies are standard TypeScript/JavaScript features
3. Mock data is included for immediate testing

### Usage

```typescript
import { 
  AnalyticsService,
  CustomerService,
  InventoryService,
  SalesService,
  initializeServices 
} from './src/services';

// Services are auto-initialized with mock data
// You can start using them immediately

// Example: Get sales analytics
const salesData = AnalyticsService.getSalesAnalytics('7d');

// Example: Search products
const products = await InventoryService.searchProducts({
  searchTerm: 'paracetamol',
  lowStock: true
});

// Example: Create a new customer
const newCustomer = await CustomerService.createCustomer({
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@email.com',
  phone: '+1234567890',
  dateOfBirth: '1990-01-01',
  medicalHistory: [],
  allergies: [],
  currentMedications: []
});
```
