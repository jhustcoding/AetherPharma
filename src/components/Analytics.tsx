Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, ResponsiveContainer, LineChart, Line, PieChart, Pie, Cell, AreaChart, Area } from 'recharts';
import { TrendingUp, DollarSign, Package, Users, Calendar, Star, AlertTriangle, Activity, Zap, Clock, Target, BarChart3, Brain, TrendingDown, PieChart as PieChartIcon, Calculator, ShoppingCart, UserCheck, Percent } from 'lucide-react';
import { mockProducts, mockSales, mockCustomers, mockCustomerPurchaseHistory } from '../data/mockData';
import { InventoryAnalyticsService } from '../services/inventoryAnalytics';
import { AnalyticsService } from '../services/analyticsService';

const Analytics: React.FC = () => {
  // ... [rest of the code remains unchanged until the end]
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* ... [rest of the JSX remains unchanged] */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Analytics;
